//-------------------------------------------
//Perhaps we could remove this duplication by moving the shared code from
//two classes into yet another class. We are going to use a technique in OOP known as inheritance.

// This class represents all that is common between Student and Mentor
class Person {
  // moved here b/c it was identical
  constructor(name, quirkyFact, pet) {
    this.name = name;
    this.quirkyFact = quirkyFact;
    this.pet = pet;
  }

  // moved here b/c it was identical
  bio() {
    return `My name is ${this.name} and here's my quirky fact: ${this.quirkyFact}`;
  }
}
//----------------------------------------
//example of inheritance below

class Student extends Person {
  // stays in Student class since it's specific to students only
  enroll(cohort) {
    this.cohort = cohort;
  }
}

class Mentor extends Person {
  // specific to mentors
  goOnShift() {
    this.onShift = true;
  }

  // specific to mentors
  goOffShift() {
    this.onShift = false;
  }
}

let studentA = new Student("Ava", "I love traveling", "Snowie");
